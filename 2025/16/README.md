# Challenge 16: 🎁 Packing gifts for Santa

**Difficulty:** 🟢 Easy

**View:** [adventjs.dev/en/challenges/2025/16](https://adventjs.dev/en/challenges/2025/16)

## Instructions

Santa wants to distribute gifts in the **most efficient way possible** 🎁. He has a list of gifts, each with a **weight**, and a sleigh that can only carry up to a **maximum weight**.

The gifts are delivered **in order**, and Santa cannot change that order. When a gift doesn't fit in the current sleigh, Santa sends the sleigh and prepares a new one.

Your task is to write a function that calculates the **minimum number of sleighs needed** to deliver all the gifts.

However, keep in mind that sometimes there is a gift that doesn't fit in the sleigh at all, in which case you must return `null` because that sleigh capacity doesn't work for that set of gifts.

## 🧩 Examples

```javascript
packGifts([2, 3, 4, 1], 5)
// 2 sleighs
// Sleigh 1: 2 + 3 = 5
// Sleigh 2: 4 + 1 = 5

packGifts([3, 3, 2, 1], 3)
// 3 sleighs
// Sleigh 1: 3
// Sleigh 2: 3
// Sleigh 3: 2 + 1 = 3

packGifts([1, 1, 1, 1], 2)
// 2 sleighs
// Sleigh 1: 1 + 1 = 2
// Sleigh 2: 1 + 1 = 2

packGifts([5, 6, 1], 5)
// null
// There is a gift weighing 6 that doesn’t fit

packGifts([], 10)
// 0 sleighs
// There are no gifts to deliver
```

``` python
def pack_gifts(gifts: list[int], maxWeight: int) -> int | None:
    num_sleighs = 0
    current_weight = 0

    for weight in gifts:
        if weight > maxWeight:
            return None

        if current_weight + weight <= maxWeight:
            current_weight += weight
        else:
            num_sleighs += 1
            current_weight = weight

    if current_weight > 0:
        num_sleighs += 1

    return num_sleighs
```
