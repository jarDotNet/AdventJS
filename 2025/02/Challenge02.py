Challenge #2: 🏭 Manufacture the toys

Santa's factory has started to receive the toy production list.
Each line indicates which toy must be manufactured and how many units.

The elves, as always, have messed things up: they wrote down some toys with quantities that don't make any sense.

You have a list of objects with this structure:

- toy: the name of the toy (string)
- quantity: how many units must be manufactured (number)

Your task is to write a function that takes this list and returns an array of strings with:

Each toy repeated as many times as indicated by quantity
In the same order in which they appear in the original list
Ignoring toys with invalid quantities (less than or equal to 0, or not a number)

🧩 Examples

const production1 = [
  { toy: 'car', quantity: 3 },
  { toy: 'doll', quantity: 1 },
  { toy: 'ball', quantity: 2 }
]

const result1 = manufactureGifts(production1)
console.log(result1)
// ['car', 'car', 'car', 'doll', 'ball', 'ball']

const production2 = [
  { toy: 'train', quantity: 0 }, // not manufactured
  { toy: 'bear', quantity: -2 }, // neither
  { toy: 'puzzle', quantity: 1 }
]

const result2 = manufactureGifts(production2)
console.log(result2)
// ['puzzle']

const production3 = []
const result3 = manufactureGifts(production3)
console.log(result3)
// []
